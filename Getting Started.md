# Getting Started

Tapestry Loom consists of three types of views: The file manager, (application-wide) settings, and editors. Unlike the other two views, editors contain multiple subviews and you can have an arbitrary number of editors open.

Editors can either be temporary, or they can be backed by a file on disk (Tapestry Loom's document format has the file extension `.tapestry`). When an editor is backed by a file on disk, changes will be automatically saved to disk. This way, if the application crashes, only very recent changes will be lost.

Tapestry Loom documents are called weaves, and will be referred to as such throughout the rest of this document.
