# Tapestry Loom Manual

Tapestry Loom consists of three types of views: The file manager, (application-wide) settings, and editors. Unlike the other two views, you can have an arbitrary number of editors open, and editors contain multiple subviews within them.

Editors can either be temporary, or they can be backed by a file on disk (Tapestry Loom's document format has the file extension `.tapestry`). When an editor is backed by a file on disk, changes will be automatically saved to disk. This way, if the application crashes, only very recent changes will be lost.

Tapestry Loom documents are called weaves, and will be referred to as such throughout the rest of this document.

## Settings view

The settings view is split into multiple sections:

- Interface
- Shortcuts
- Document
- Inference
- Editor inference defaults

The exact settings available will change over time, but this document will provide a brief overview of the most important available settings.

More information about a specific setting can often be found by hovering over the setting's UI element until a tooltip appears.

### Shortcuts

Tapestry Loom has various keyboards shortcuts which can allow the user to more quickly execute common actions. You can click on a shortcut's button to change it, and you can press escape while editing a shortcut to reset it to it's default value.

On MacOS, shortcuts containing Ctrl can be triggered using either the control or command keyboard buttons.
